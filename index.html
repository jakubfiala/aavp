		<i>ripple</i> is a simple, yet powerful interface for live MIDI sequencing, written in C++/openframeworks.
		Inspired by instruments such as the tenori-on, it consists of a grid of buttons that correspond
		to individual MIDI pitch values. The user first creates a sequence by selecting a button, and then
		toggles the playback mode, where by clicking on a particular button, a tempo-synced &lsquo;wave&rsquo; is created.
		Whenever the wave encounters a toggled button, a note is triggered polyphonically. The app can be used
		as live MIDI input into synths in any kind of DAW &mdash; however, it is necessary to create a virtual MIDI routing, e.g. with
		midi-patchbay.
		<br><br>
		There are four additional options:
		<ul>
			<li>tempo control to change the BPM</li>
			<li>a MIDI toggle to switch between in-app sound and MIDI output</li>
			<li>toggle to change the mapping of the grid to MIDI notes</li>
			<li>toggle to switch between square and line wave types</li>
		</ul>
		<i>Notes on implementation</i><br>
		The app was developed with a particular approach to live performance in mind – one where the musician
		explores the given set of triggers, whose musical mapping isn't immediately obvious. In order to encourage
		such an approach, I have designed the grid in unconventional dimensions, i.e. not according to the twelve-tone
		divisions of pitches.<br>
		Although by default, in-app sound is enabled, the app is primarily useful with external MIDI instruments.
		I have included the simple native Maximilian synth merely because a user might want to test their chosen sequence
		before engaging with the external synth.<br>
		Further development on this app might include: support for external MIDI clock, more types of waves/mappings,
		custom ADSR option, etc.

		<i>maxiBark</i> is an implementation of Bark scale spectral analysis in Maximilian, a C++ DSP library by Mick Grierson/Chris Kiefer.
		It works with the ofxMaxim plugin for openframeworks. It has three methods for obtaining loudness based on this perceptual scale:
		<ul>
			<li><i>specificLoudness</i> &ndash; an array of absolute loudness values for each of the 24 Bark bands</li>
			<li><i>relativeLoudness</i> &ndash; loudness of each Bark band, relative to the loudest band</li>
			<li><i>totalLoudness</i> &ndash; absolute loudness of all bands, summed</li>
		</ul>

		<i>basstomid</i> is an extremely simple VST plugin that achieves a rudimental, yet essential effect
		on audio mixes: it accepts a stereo signal, which it converts to mono below the specified frequency.
		This is important for example for vinyl mastering, where heavily panned low-frequency content can cause
		dislocation of the needle.

		<i>theenemiismi</i> is an experimental computer vision game implemented in openframeworks, where the user is attacked
		by a host of enemies in the form of their own face expressions. They can then defeat the opponents by catching
		them with their face.
