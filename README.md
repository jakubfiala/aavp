this includes:

+ ripple MIDI sequencer
+ basstomid VST plugin
+ maxiBark class for the [Maximilian](http://maximilian.strangeloop.com) C++ DSP library
+ a silly opencv app that adds creepy glasses to your face
+ an experiment with Maximilian's `bufferPlay` method for creating weird noises by drawing waveforms

//the website also uses the `cjk-ideographic` list bullet style, which I think is incredibly awesome.
